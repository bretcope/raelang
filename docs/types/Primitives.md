# Primitive Types

Primitive types are built into the language. They are the only types which are allowed to begin with a lowercase letter. All derived types must begin with a capital letter.

The following primitives exist in the language:

| Type Group | Primitive Names |

| Floating Point | float32, float64 |
| Binary | byte |
| Boolean | bool |
| Character | char, string |
