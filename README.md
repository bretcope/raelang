# RaeLang

This isn't a real language. It will likely never be a real language. It's more of a thought experiment on how I might design a language if I were designing one.
  
## Big Picture

The primary guiding principle is "opt into complexity." It borrows from functional styles in that it strongly encourages immutablility and discourages side-effects, but still allows you to opt-in to that complexity if you really need it. Most of these ideas come from other languages, and I'm sure even the stuff that I came up with on my own has probably already been implemented in some language (possibly better than the way I describe it here).

Again, this isn't a real language or spec. It's incomplete, and all my opinions are subject to change. There are tons more things I haven't even touched on yet and/or haven't thought through well.
